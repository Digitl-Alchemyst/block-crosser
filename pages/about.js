                    During my 5+ years of undergrad in Toronto, I saw the City install 2 new 
                    crosswalks in the riskiest spots surrounding Queen's Park. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    This was great, since crossing at these spots meant 
                    taking perhaps the dumbest high-risk low-reward gamble ever 
                    - a gamble I took many times ðŸ¤¡</p>
                <p>
                    Everyone thought that these intersections were a death trap, but there was
                    no way to really prove it, outside of <span className="italic">actual deaths.</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    That&apos;s what crossywalk is: a place for everyone to suggest and upvote 
                    crosswalks they think should exist.
                </p>

                    Probably won't do much, but what&apos;s the harm in trying? ðŸ¤“
