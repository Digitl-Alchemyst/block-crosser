                    During my 5+ years of undergrad in Toronto, I saw the City install 2 new 
                    crosswalks in the riskiest spots surrounding Queen's Park. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    This was great, especially considering how crossing at these spots meant 
                    taking perhaps the dumbest high-risk low-reward gamble a person 
                    could ever take - a gamble I took many times ðŸ¤¡</p>
                <p>
                    But that got me thinking - how did it take the better part of 5 years for these
                    crosswalks to get installed?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Everyone I knew thought that these intersections were a death trap, so surely 
                    the City understood as well.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Maybe they did, or maybe they didn't. Either way, that's why crossywalk exists: so you
                    can finally suggest and upvote crosswalks you think should exist.
