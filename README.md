[Crossywalk](https://crossywalk.com) is a platform to suggest and vote on new crosswalks. 

More personal project-ish than a real thing, but my goal was to build something with maps and get more familiar with Prisma. 

### Stack
- Next.js
- Mapbox, Google Maps geocoding and places
- PostgreSQL + Prisma ORM (using my student credits for once lol)
- Deployed on Vercel with Plausible analytics
